[ ![Codeship Status for Roverr/go-auth](https://codeship.com/projects/88e72ab0-0b34-0134-b18c-129a07c0a376/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/155801)

## Why?
This project is like a TODO MVC for me in Golang, except it is just a basic authentication API where users can register, login, get information about themselves, and finally delete their profiles if they wish to.

### Attention! This project might contain anti-pattern implementations!

## Install project
If you would like to install the project, you should have atleast Go 1.6 environment ready. After that you can install the project by typing:
```
go get github.com/roverr/go-auth
```

You can test recursively by typing
```
go test ./...
```
If you would like to see the tests one by one, you should add -v
flag to the end of the command.
